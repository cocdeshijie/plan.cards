# Card Template Reference
# ============================================================================
# This file documents every supported field for community-contributed
# card templates. It is NOT loaded by the application — it's purely
# for reference when creating or editing templates.
#
# Each template lives at:  card_templates/<issuer>/<card_slug>/card.yaml
# Optional card images at:  card_templates/<issuer>/<card_slug>/card.png
#   (also accepts .jpg, .jpeg, .webp)
#   Multiple image variants: card.png (default), floral.png, mirror.png, etc.
#   Any *.{png,jpg,jpeg,webp} file in the card directory or its old/ subdirectory
#   is picked up as a selectable image variant. card.png is always the default.
#
# Old versions live at:  card_templates/<issuer>/<card_slug>/old/card_<version_id>.yaml
#   Optional old image:  card_templates/<issuer>/<card_slug>/old/card_<version_id>.png
#
# The template ID is derived from the path: "<issuer>/<card_slug>"
#   e.g. card_templates/chase/sapphire_reserve/card.yaml → "chase/sapphire_reserve"
